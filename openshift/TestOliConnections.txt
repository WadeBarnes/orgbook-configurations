# Uses the 'testConnection' script from https://github.com/BCDevOps/openshift-developer-tools
# Example:
# echo -e "offline-indexer-oli\n backup-bc" | xargs -I {} testConnection -n 8ad0ea-dev -f TestOliConnections.txt -p {}

# Expected results:
#   - offline-indexer-oli can connect to both database instances and both search-engine instances.
#   - backup-bc can connect to both database instances, but NOT the search-engine instances.
